<h1>Aaaaand I'm back online</h1>

<p>After a few months of changes, I'm back online with a self-built, self-hosted, fiber-powered home server. More on that later.</p>

<p>This website is my homepage, you'll find <a href="/news/">news</a> from me, <a href="/stuff/">stuff</a> that I find interesting, my current <a href="/projects/">projects</a> and how you can <a href="/contact/">contact</a> me.</p>

<p>Anything fixed and time-related will be under the news section, everything else will be listed in the stuff section.</p>
